# Material for the workshop "Data Visualization and Communication Using Python And Jupyter" with focus on Earth Sciences at the Data Science Center (DSC), University of Bremen

The material in this repository includes:

    Notebooks_Exercises (Python notebooks with code for time series analysis and prediction including unsolved exercises)
    Notebooks_Solutions (Python notebooks with code for time series analysis and prediction including exercises with solutions)
    Images (images loaded in the code)
    Datasets (datasets loaded in the code)
    Slides (presented during the workshop)
    requirements.txt (List of libraries required to run the notebooks)

The notebooks contain:

    A) Quickstart into Python
    B) Data visualization in Python including Earth Sciences examples

To install the libraries open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Running shell commands directly from a code cell in Jupyter Notebook is also possible by prefixing the command with an exclamation mark: !pip install -r requirements.txt

The material was developed by Annika Nolte. The sources and references for images, datasets and parts of code are given in the notebooks. Note that the provided notebooks were created with greatest care, but no guarantee can be given for the correctness of the analyses.
